= Deploying a WebSphere Application Using OpenShift Pipelines

== Introduction

OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Every task runs as a pod, and each step runs as a container within that pod. You can use OpenShift pipelines to deploy your WebSphere apps. TA generates a basic pipeline that you can use as a starting point.

== Steps

In this section, we will be walking you through the deployment of an OpenShift Pipeline that we will use to deploy your WebSphere application.

=== Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the necessary repository:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/gskumar1010/TA-klp-demo
----

Then, change directory to the newly cloned repository by running the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd TA-klp-demo
----

=== Create Pipeline Resources

The cluster admin has already installed the OC Pipelines operator. It is time to create our pipeline.

The first thing we need to do is create a project for our pipeline. Run the following command to create the project:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc new-project websphere-pipelines-%username%
----

Now we will create the pipeline resources. The IBM Transformation Advisor automatically generates the necessary yaml definitions for creating an OpenShift Pipeline that can deploy our WebSphere application.

We need to create each of these resources using the provided yaml definitions.

`00-apply-manifest-task.yaml` and `00-update-deployment_task.yaml` are custom tasks used by the pipeline.

Run the following command to create the apply manifest task.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/00-apply-manifest-task.yaml
----

Run the following command to create the update deployment task.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/00-update-deployment_task.yaml
----

`01-pipeline.yaml` is the definition for the pipeline itself. Run the following command to create the pipeline.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/01-pipeline.yaml
----

`pv-claim.yaml` will create the persistent storage that the pipeline uses for persistent storage between tasks. Run the following command to create the storage.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/02-pv-claim.yaml
----

=== Run the Pipeline

With all of our resources in place, we are ready to run our pipeline!

Importing `03-pipeline-run.yaml` will cause the pipeline to run and build our application.

In the OpenShift web UI, click on the `+` in the upper right hand corner to import our yaml. Copy and paste the yaml below and then click `Create`.

```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: using-build-and-deploy-
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-and-deploy
  workspaces:
  - name: build-workspace
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: shared-task-storage
  params:
  - name: repo-url
    value: https://github.com/gskumar1010/TA-klp-demo.git
  - name: branch-name
    value: master
  - name: repo-dockerfile
    value: Dockerfile
  - name: image-url
    value: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/websphere-pipelines-%username%/websphere-pipeline:latest
```

The process will take a couple of minutes.

You can view the pipeline's status in the OpenShift UI at:
```
console-openshift-console.%cluster_subdomain%
```

The pipeline will clone the application's repo, build the application, apply manifests, and update the image.

To see more detailed information about what's going on, select the `Logs` tab.

image::./Images/PipelinesRunningLogs.png[image]

After a few minutes the pipeline run will complete and our application will be deployed.

=== Access and Test the Application

Once the deployment is complete we can access the application at the following url:

```
http://ta-klp-demo-rehost-websphere-%username%.%cluster_subdomain%/hitcount
```

NOTE: Make sure you are using `http` instead of `https`.

Select `Enterprise Java Bean (CMP)` as the method of execution, `Global Namespace` as the lookup method, and `Commit` as the transaction type. Click `Increment`.

You will see a message indicating that the count has been incremented.

In this section we were able to create an OpenShift Pipeline to deploy our application using the files generated by IBM's Transformation Advisor.
