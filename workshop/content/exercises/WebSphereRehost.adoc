= Rehosting a WebSphere Application

== Introduction

IBM WebSphere Application Server accelerates application delivery with a highly reliable Java Enterprise Edition-based runtime environment. It supports microservices and standards-based programming models designed to help you modernize at your own pace, gain visibility across workloads, analyze enterprise applications and advance your journey to Kubernetes.

== Steps

In this section, we will be walking you through the deployment of an existing WebSphere application onto OpenShift without making any modifications to the code.

=== Select Project

// just give the command to create the project  in the command line (don't worry about UI at all) or update directions about location of creation
Go to the `Projects` tab and select the project `rehost-websphere-%username%` and click `Create`.
Note: In case the project does not exist you can choose 'Create Project' on the top of the dropdown selection

=== Deploy Application

//you're logged in the developer view by default... no need to change view
We are going to switch to Developer perspective for the remainder of this section.

Click `+Add` in the upper left corner and select `From DockerFile`.

//update image for add dockerfile

Enter the GitHub Repo URL `https://github.com/gskumar1010/TA-klp-demo`. The fields will be auto-populated.

We need to update the port so that the deployment uses port 9080.

Scroll to the bottom where you will see a message `Click on the names to access advanced options for Routing, Health checks, Build configuration...`

Click on `Routing`. This will give us more options. Enter `9080` for `Target port` and click on the drop down option `Create "9080"`.

Click `Create`.

We can watch the application deployment in the `Topology` tab. The deployment will take a few minutes. We can click the icon to see more information about the deployment.

//add details about viewing builds from that side menu in Topology view

=== Access and Test the Application

Once the deployment is complete, we can access the application by using the URL under the Routes section of the Deployment information.

Take the URL and add `/hitcount` to the end of it so that we hit our Hit Count application's end point.

NOTE: Make sure you are using `http` instead of `https`.

For example `http://ta-klp-demo-rehost-websphere.apps.ocp.shadowman.dev/hitcount`

Select `Enterprise Java Bean (CMP)` as the method of execution, `Global Namespace` as the lookup method, and `Commit` as the transaction type. Click `Increment`.

image::./Images/HitCountApplication03.png[image]

You will see a message indicating that the count has been incremented.

To test the session persistence, open a different browser window and perform the same actions to increment the count. Notice the count is consistent across the browsers.

== Review

As you saw, when we say "no code changes" we mean **no code changes**. We were able to containerize our WebSphere application and deploy it onto OpenShift without ever editing a line of code.
