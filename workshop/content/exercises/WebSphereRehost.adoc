= Rehosting a WebSphere Application

== Introduction

IBM WebSphere Application Server accelerates application delivery with a highly reliable Java Enterprise Edition-based runtime environment. It supports microservices and standards-based programming models designed to help you modernize at your own pace, gain visibility across workloads, analyze enterprise applications and advance your journey to Kubernetes.

== Steps

In this section, we will be walking you through the deployment of an existing WebSphere application onto OpenShift without making any modifications to the code.

=== Create Project

To create the project for our application, run the following command:
```
oc create rehost-websphere-%username%
```

=== Deploy Application

Open the OpenShift UI at:
```
console-openshift-console.%cluster_subdomain%
```

We are going to be using the Developer perspective for the remainder of this section. If you are not already in the Developer perspective, switch over now.

Click `+Add` in the upper left corner and select `From DockerFile`.

//update image for add dockerfile

Enter the GitHub Repo URL `https://github.com/gskumar1010/TA-klp-demo`. The fields will be auto-populated.

We need to update the port so that the deployment uses port 9080.

//Scroll to the bottom where you will see a message `Click on the names to access advanced options for Routing, Health checks, Build configuration...`
Underneath `Advanced options`, click on `Show advanced routing options` to give us more options.

//Click on `Routing`. This will give us more options. Enter `9080` for `Target port` and click on the drop down option `Create "9080"`.
Enter `9080` for `Target port` then click on the drop down option `Create "9080"`.

Click `Create`.

We can watch the application deployment in the `Topology` tab. The deployment will take a few minutes. We can click the icon to see more information about the deployment.

//add details about viewing builds from that side menu in Topology view

=== Access and Test the Application

//Once the deployment is complete, we can access the application by using the URL under the Routes section of the Deployment information.

//image::./Images/WebSphereRoutes.png[image]

//Take the URL and add `/hitcount` to the end of it so that we hit our Hit Count application's end point.

Once the deployment is complete we can access the application at the following url:

```
http://ta-klp-demo-rehost-websphere-%username%.%cluster_subdomain%/hitcount
```

NOTE: Make sure you are using `http` instead of `https`.

Select `Enterprise Java Bean (CMP)` as the method of execution, `Global Namespace` as the lookup method, and `Commit` as the transaction type. Click `Increment`.

You will see a message indicating that the count has been incremented.

To test the session persistence, open a different browser window and perform the same actions to increment the count. Notice the count is consistent across the browsers.

== Review

As you saw, when we say "no code changes" we mean **no code changes**. We were able to containerize our WebSphere application and deploy it onto OpenShift without ever editing a line of code.
